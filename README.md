# TogetherNotes Android App

**TogetherNotes** is an Android application designed to connect musicians and venues, enabling them to manage performances, communicate, and rate each other. The app operates similarly to a dating app, where musicians and venues are matched based on their preferences and needs, allowing them to collaborate and schedule events easily.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Musicians and venues can register and create a profile, including their details such as name, contact information, music genres, type of venue, and more.
- **Chat Functionality**: Musicians and venues can message each other in real-time to discuss performances, schedules, and other details.
- **Calendar of Performances**: The app allows users to manage their performances, providing a clear overview of upcoming, past, and scheduled events.
- **Ratings and Reviews**: Musicians can rate venues, and vice versa, based on their experiences and performances.
- **Geolocation**: Users can search for nearby venues or musicians based on their location, making it easier to find suitable opportunities for performances or collaborations.
- **Push Notifications**: Receive notifications about upcoming performances, messages, ratings, and changes in events.

## Technologies

- **Kotlin**: The app is developed using Kotlin, ensuring a modern and efficient codebase.
- **Firebase**: Firebase is used for real-time notifications, user authentication, and database management.
